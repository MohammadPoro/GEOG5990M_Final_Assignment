# GEOG5990M Final Assignment
This project called "Access to Healthy Assets & Hazards" (AHAH) focuses on measuring the 'healthiness' of neighbourhoods in Great Britain using the AHAH index, which combines indicators from four different domains: Retail environment, Health services, Physical environment, and Air quality. The data for the project has been provided by the Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC), the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and the UK Data Service Census.
Furthermore, this project with the help of spatial datasets for LSOAs and Local Authority District (LAD) boundaries and integrating spatial and non-spatial data for visualization provides new insights for the UK region's AHAH index, particularly in the Yorkshire and Humber region.
Overall, the project aims to analyze and visualize the AHAH data to gain insights into the distribution of healthy assets and hazards in the Yorkshire and Humber region and Leeds LAD, and also provide valuable information for organizations focused on public health or community well-being.
The repository includes four data files: AHAH_V3.csv, Eng_LSOA.zip, LAD.zip, and LSOA.csv. These files are the contributed data that are necessary for running the provided Python code (Final_Project_201790509.ipynb).

The AHAH_V3.csv file contains the AHAH data, which includes the AHAH index percentiles and other variables related to accessibility domains such as health services, physical environment, air quality, and retail environment.

The Eng_LSOA.zip file contains the spatial data for Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) in England. LSOAs are geographical divisions that encompass a certain number of households and individuals.

The LAD.zip file contains the spatial data for Local Authority Districts (LADs) in the UK. LADs are administrative divisions at the local government level.

The LSOA.csv file provides information about the LSOAs, built-up area sub-divisions (BUASD), built-up areas (BUA), local authority districts (LAD) and regions (RGN) components.
